This project analyzes the influence of market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) on actual trading behavior from Hyperliquid trader data. Submitted as part of the Data Science Internship at Primetrade.ai.

🧠 Objective
Analyze whether crypto traders behave differently during Fear vs Greed periods, using:

Trading data from Hyperliquid
Sentiment labels from the Fear & Greed Index
🔬 Analysis Highlights
Larger trade size and higher PnL during Greed
Higher fee spend in Greed suggests increased trading activity
Buy trades are more dominant in Greed than Fear
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Google Colab for notebook
GitHub for code versioning
